# Kick and Punch detection Notebook
This came as a group idea, we started as a class project. However, we couldn't get a good accuracy.

We used a dataset that we created from scratch, after watching MMA's videos on youtube, and looking for different fight images on the internet.

The dataset can be downloaded from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/georgebrown/punch-and-kick-detection-group). This tool allowed us to do the image classification, and the split of the dataset, which is very interisting and easy to go.

So far, we have tried different  [Keras](https://keras.io/api/applications/) applications such as vgg16, ResNet50V2, and InceptionResNetV2.
